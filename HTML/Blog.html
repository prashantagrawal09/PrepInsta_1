<h2> History of Cricket </h2>
<pre style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><i>The game of cricket goes long back to British times. When it was introduced in India, very few people played this game. The Maharaja of Patiala, 
Bhupinder Singh brought this game into limelight. He was a great patron of sports. He played cricket and he had his own team. Cricket was
his second love after his kingdom. He was the man behind the golden history of cricket due to his passion for the game. His team Patiala XI
was the best team during that time and he was the captain of the Indian team. He himself sponsored his teams for the tours to England.

<h2>How is Cricket Played? </h2>
<pre style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><i>
Cricket is a game played by two teams of eleven players each on a pitch with two sets of three stumps, which are called wickets. The bowler 
bowls the ball down the pitch to the batsman of the opposing team, who must defend the wickets in front of which he stands. The target of the 
game is to score as many runs as possible. 

Runs are scored by individual players by running on the playing strip (called pitch) between the wickets, or by hitting a ball that flies outside 
the boundary of the playground or which falls inside the boundary but bounces or rolls outside. When the balls go directly outside the boundary, 
the batsman scores six runs, and when the ball falls within the boundary but rolls outside then the batsman scores four runs. The opponent team 
will bowl and field and their objective is to take the wickets for each of the batsmen playing on the pitch. 
    
    
A batsman can be dismissed in one of several ways: by the bowler hitting the wicket with the ball, which is called, bowled; by a fielder catching 
the ball hit by the batsman before it touches the ground and it is called caught; by the wicket-keeper or another fielder breaking the stumps 
while the batsman attempts a run and is therefore out of his ground. This is called stumped or run out. A batsman can also be dismissed if the 
batsman breaks the wicket with his own bat or body and this is called a hit wicket; by a part of the batsman’s body being hit by a ball that 
would otherwise have hit the wicket is called leg before the wicket or “lbw”. 
    
    
A match consists of one or two innings, and each inning ends when the tenth batsman of the batting team is out, when a certain number of overs 
(an over: a series of six balls bowled) have been played or when the captain of the batting team declares ending the innings voluntarily.
